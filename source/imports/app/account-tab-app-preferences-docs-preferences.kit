<p>by default, when you create a new document, cryptee makes it available offline on the device you created it. if you prefer, you can disable this, which will make cryptee work online-first, similarly to spotify, so that you can choose which docs to make available offline by hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<button class="bold appPreference radio selected" group="docs-auto-offline-new-docs" val="offline-first">offline first</button>
<button class="bold appPreference radio"          group="docs-auto-offline-new-docs" val="online-first">online first</button>

<p class="bold">local document cache</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>

<p>cryptee uses an encrypted, local cache on your device to speed things up a bit instead of downloading &amp; decrypting everything every single time. during bad network connectivity or frequent drop-outs, cryptee falls back to this cache to keep running as expected, and reduce network dependency.</p>

<p>if you're experiencing issues that are <i>specific to this device</i>, like filenames not updating on this device or not sync'ing correctly to/from this device, or your search results not returning everything you're looking for, you can try clearing your local cache here. if clearing the cache using the button below doesn't solve your problem, please contact our helpdesk.</p>
