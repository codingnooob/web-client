              <h4><dd class="paragraph">Cryptee uses two passwords to keep your data secure. An <b>account password</b> and an <b>encryption key</b>.<br /><br>Account password is like any other password you had before. It's what you use to sign in to your account. If you lose this password, and have an email on file, you can recover this.</dd></h4>

              <h2 class="subtitle"><dt><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-key"></i></span> What is an encryption key? </dt></h2>
              <h4><dd class="paragraph">The encryption key is what keeps your files more secure than ever. Before your files are uploaded they are encrypted with this key on your device. We don't have / see / keep this key ever. This means that before your files leave your device, they are heavily encrypted, and we only store the encrypted files, without the keys. And when your files are downloaded / opened, they are decrypted using this key on your device.<br><br><b>Important!</b> If you ever lose your encryption key, your files will be forever inaccessible, and there is no way to recover this key nor your files.</dd></h4>

              <h2 class="subtitle"><dt><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-eye-slash"></i></span> What is a Ghost Folder? </dt></h2>
              <h4><dd class="paragraph">We recognize the possibility that you might find yourself in situations which require you to hand over access to your account under stressful/forceful conditions. Ghost folders are a feature which allows you to hide certain documents and have deniability in these situations.<br><br>When you make a ghost (hidden) folder, this folder is temporarily removed from your account. It can only be brought back (summoned) by typing its exact name in the "Summon Ghost Folder" field. Only then it will reappear in your account. This way, you can deny the existence of the folder entirely.</dd></h4>

              <h2 class="subtitle"><dt><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-paperclip"></i></span> What is an attachment? </dt></h2>
              <h4><dd class="paragraph">Attachments allow you to upload files to cryptee, and later refer/link to them in your documents. Say for example if you are in a class / meeting, taking notes on cryptee, and your peer sent you a PDF. You can easily link this PDF to your notes in a specific spot, and keep on typing.</dd></h4>

              <h4><dd class="paragraph">Your Home Document is a central place, catch-all for your random notes. Because let's be honest, not everything is easy to categorize.</dd></h4>
