                    sadly, the road you're looking for doesn't exist anymore, or perhaps it never did. so here's a 1916 poem, called <i>"The Road Not Taken"</i> by Robert Frost, accompanied by a beautiful photograph of a dead-end road, taken by Niklas Hamann.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <b>ROAD NOT TAKEN</b><br><br>
                    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                    And sorry I could not travel both<br>
                    And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                    And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                    To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
                    <br>
                    Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
                    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
                    Though as for that the passing there<br>
                    Had worn them really about the same,<br>
                    <br>
                    And both that morning equally lay<br>
                    In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                    Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
                    I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
                    <br>
                    I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
                    Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
                    Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
                    I took the one less traveled by,<br>
                    And that has made all the difference.<br>
