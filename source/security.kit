          <h2>Front-End Encryption</h2>
          <p><b>Your documents, files and contacts never leave your device unencrypted.</b></p>
          <p>They are encrypted at all times using AES-128, with your encryption key, which we do not have access to.</p>

          <br>

          <p><b>We can't see the contents of your documents, files or contacts. Only you can.</b></p>
          <p>This means two things: </p>
          <p>1 - Even if a government comes asking for your data, we can only provide them with the encrypted data. AES-128 means it would take millions of years to crack open even with supercomputers.</p>
          <p>2 - Regardless of what servers / cloud infrastructure we use, your files are only accessible to you. This means that we don't have to operate or maintain our own expensive physical servers, and that we can use any cloud provider with confidence. This allows us to reduce costs, and provide a more reliable service to you. Knowing that even if our servers are compromised, or your data is seized, no third party can have access to your data.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>With Cryptee, data privacy isn't just a promise. It is mathematically ensured.</b></p>

          <br>

          <h2>Open Source Cryptography</h2>
          <p><b>We only use the open sourced <a href="https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs" target="_blank"> OpenPGP.js</a></b></p>
          <p>Using open-source cryptography means, we can verifiably guarantee that our encryption algorithms do not have any backdoors.</p>
          <p>Cryptee's open source software is also regularly thoroughly tested by security experts globally, to make sure we can provide the best and unbiased protection.</p>

          <br>

          <h2>Anonymity</h2>
          <p><b>No personally identifiable information required for signup.</b></p>
          <p>We do not track or log any user activity, nor do we require an email or any other form of personally identifiable information from you.</p>
          <p>Combine this with our front-end encryption, this also means that we can't serve you targeted advertisements. (We hate ads as much as you do.)</p>

          <br>

          <h2>Ultimate Deniability</h2>
          <p><b>Cryptee is built to protect you against forceful access to your account.</b></p>
          <p>We know that there may come a day, and someone may ask you to login and unlock your data, by means of force, coercion, torture, or psychological pressure.</p>
          <p>In cryptography, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis" target="_blank">"Rubberhose Cryptanalysis"</a>. Here's an <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/" target="_blank">XKCD comic</a> describing exactly this.</p>
          <p>Our "Ghost Folders" feature is here to protect you in these tough situations, where there is an assymmetry of power.</p>
          <p>You can "ghost" a folder, and it will be removed from your account, until you type the name of that folder again.</p>
          <p>This means that even if you are forced to comply, and hand over keys to your account to a third party, your data will still be safe, and you can deny the existence of certain files and folders.</p>

          <br>

          <h2>SSL Connections</h2>
          <p><b>A necessity in our day of age. We only serve our pages over SSL.</b></p>
          <p>This ensures that the communications between our servers and your devices are secured, and not tampered with by third parties. Combined with our encryption, Cryptee also protects you from all types of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.</p>

          <br>

          <h2>Based in Estonia</h2>
          <p><b>We are incorporated in Estonia</b></p>
          <p>Famously named "the most advanced digital society in the world" by Wired, Estonia is leading a technological revolution at state level.</p>
          <p>This means we are based outside of U.S. and 14 eyes jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>This also means that we can only disclose the very limited and encrypted information have to third parties, only if there's an Estonian court order.</p>

          <br>

          <h2>Easy to use</h2>
          <p><b>The greatest weakness in most security systems, is the human-factor.</b></p>
          <p>We strongly believe that security and privacy should be very easy to use. In fact, if possible, so easy that it should be invisible to the user.</p>
          <p>We designed Cryptee with this in mind. There is nothing to install, no encryption keys to manage, or no special unique user interfaces.</p>
