<b>2-Factor Authentication</b>
<br><br>
<p>We strongly recommend using 2-Factor Authentication, as it adds a layer of protection against simple keylogger attacks. <br>Currently we support time-based 2-factor authentication methods (like Google Authenticator), however support for U2F Keys (like Yubico) and Estonian ID-cards are also on the way.</p>
