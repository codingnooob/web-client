          <p>Once upon a time, there was a software developer / minimalist / pianist. 
            He lived in NY, and had a Master's degree in gadgetry &amp; magic from Carnegie Mellon University. 
            He would wear his tin-foil hat every day and think:
            "Wouldn't it be amazing if there was a way to keep my files and photos safe, without big companies taking a look at them?"<br>

            <br><br>
            <img src="../imgs/illustrations/coder.svg" alt="Cryptee – Story" class="story-illustration"><br>


            <br> Every day, for a whole year, he came home from his uninspiring 9 to 5 job, and coded his dream software.
            One day, while drinking wine on his rooftop he realized the most awful thing.
            As a European, living in U.S. on a work visa, he can't just casually start up a company in the U.S! It would invalidate his visa. Because yay freedom (!) :(
            <br>

            <br><br>
            <img src="../imgs/illustrations/moving.svg" alt="Cryptee – Story 2" class="story-illustration">
            <br><br>

            <br>
            So he thought to himself, "Fuck this. I'm moving to Europe!" and in a mere, short 30 days, he packed his tiny studio apartment in NY, moved to a magical country called Estonia and started up his dream company with his savings.

          <h3 class="title is-4 is-spaced has-text-centered">Estonia? Where is that?</h3>
          <p class="has-text-centered">Europe, Planet Earth.</p>
          <p>It's a small nordic country, two hours of ferry ride below Finland, named "the most advanced digital society in the world" by Wired.
            It is a country that has e-residents, a government that runs on blockchain, cold weather, and a strange love for saunas.
            Home to Skype, TransferWise, Teleport, Leapin and many other fantastic startups that are aiming to make the world a better place to live.</p>
          <p>The city you see in the picture is Tallinn, capital of Estonia, and yes it's actually as small and beautiful as you think it is.</p>
