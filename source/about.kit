                Once upon a time, there was a software developer / minimalist / pianist.
                He lived in NY, and had a Master's degree in gadgetry &amp; magic from Carnegie Mellon University.
                He would wear his tin-foil hat every day and think:
                "Wouldn't it be amazing if there was a way to keep my files and photos safe, without big companies
                taking a look at them?"
            </p>

            <img class="about-img" src="../imgs/illustrations/moving.svg" alt="John Packing to Move">

            <p class="lowercase justify">
                Every day, for a whole year, he came home from his uninspiring 9 to 5 job, and coded his dream software.
                One day, while drinking wine on his rooftop he realized the most awful thing.
                As a European, living in U.S. on a work visa, he can't just casually start up a company in the U.S! It
                would invalidate his visa. Because yay freedom (!) :(
            </p>

            <p class="lowercase justify">
                So he thought to himself, "Fuck this. I'm moving to Europe!" and in a mere, short 30 days, he packed his tiny studio apartment in NY, moved to a magical country called Estonia and started up his dream company with his savings.

                It's a small nordic country, two hours of ferry ride below Finland, named "the most advanced digital society in the world" by the Wired magazine.
                <br><br>
                A country that has e-residents, a government that runs on blockchain, filming locations you may have seen in a fancy christopher nolan movie called “tenet”, a fucking cold weather, and a strange love for absurdly hot saunas. 
                Home to Skype, TransferWise, Starship, Teleport, Xolo and many other fantastic startups that are aiming to make the world a better place to live.
                <br><br>
                The city you see in the picture is Tallinn, capital of Estonia, and yes it's actually as small and beautiful as you think it is.

                The minimalist / pianist person who made Cryptee. Coder with MS from Carnegie Mellon, who once made weird tech projects for big fancy-name tech companies, not listed here to avoid search engine optimization headaches. He was also at the Oscars™ in 2016 but not for the usual reasons you'd expect.
