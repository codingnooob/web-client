              <p><strong>Error Reporting &amp; Abuse Detection</strong></br>
              <p>We have an automatic error collection, abuse detection and reporting system. The error reports are anonymous, but linked to our support system via anonymous user IDs to better help you out. We keep these only for 90 days.
                Our abuse detection system automatically collects and retains IP addresses and browser user agents for 180 days, but these are deleted once they're no longer relevant.</p>

          <div class="column content privacy-lawyers">
            <p>Our policy is to collect as little user information as possible to ensure a completely private and anonymous user experience when using the Service. We also have no technical means to access the contents of your encrypted data, documents or photos.</p>
            <p>Service's user data collection is as follows:</p>

            <p><strong>Visiting our website</strong></br>
            The Service employs an analytics software created specifically by the Company, and not a 3rd party analytics solution to further improve security, privacy and anonymity. Using this solution we may at times track usage metrics, design improvements and track new features' adoption on our pages completely anonymously, without collecting any identifiable pieces of information.</p>
            <p>These pieces of information are only collected in each unique session, without storing any trackers on the users' devices longer than each session, without tracking across sessions, with the sole purpose to improve our features, improve user experiences, increase new feature adoption and write better tutorials to guide our users.</p>

            <p><strong>Account creation</strong></br>
            We do not require ANY personal information to create an account but you may provide an email address, Smart ID or Mobile ID numbers and Phone numbers for login and password recovery purposes. Should you choose to provide it, we do associate these information with your account (to be able to provide you the Service). We will also store your account creation time.</p>

            <p><strong>Account activity</strong></br>
            To provide you the Service, we have access to the following metadata: folder colors, number of documents/files/photos in each folder or album, document &amp; bytesizes after encryption, generation/version identifiers for each document/file/photo (to let you know if a document/file was changed on another device of yours), amount of storage space used, last opened document/file's id#, numerical sort order of files and folders based on their IDs, payment activation and deactivation dates, first payment date, all payment amounts, upcoming and past payment dates, subscription plan associated with your account, whether a discount was applied or not, payment time and the type of the payment method used. <br><br>We do NOT have access to the contents of encrypted photos or documents/files. We do NOT have access to any specific payment information. More information regarding payments related information is below.</p>

            <p><strong>Communicating with the Company</strong></br>
            Your communications with the Company, such as support requests (processed via Kayako, contact details &amp; privacy policy below), bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff, to improve our service and knowledge base featuring frequently asked questions.</p>

            <p><strong>Error Reporting &amp; Abuse Detection</strong></br>
            Should an error occur while you're using the Service, depending on the error, our automatic error collection and reporting system may collect your unique user ID while reporting the error to our error collection system. (processed via Sentry IO, contact details &amp; privacy policy below) These collected Errors are automatically linked to our support system, and can be used to further clarify / investigate issues. These error reports are only retained for 90 days.
            We do not, and can't collect any personal / identifiable information with our error collection system. Our system may collect information like : (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, and (6) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of errors or attacks on our systems. Our abuse detection system automatically collects and retains IP addresses and browser user agents for 180 days, however these are deleted once they are no longer relevant.</p>

            <p><strong>Payment Information</strong></br>
            The Company relies on a third party to process payments, so the Company necessarily must share your user identification number with the payment processor to be able to know which account the payment will be applied to. We do not otherwise store any of your payment information.</p>
            <p>All payments are processed by Paddle.com Market Ltd, 15 Bermondsey Square, SE1 3UN London, United Kingdom, as merchant of record.</p>

            <p>As the payment process is entirely and independently carried out by Paddle.com, you submit the relevant payment data, especially your payment details and your email address, directly to Paddle.com. You can find their Privacy Policy at <a href="https://paddle.com/legal">paddle.com/legal</a>. This use by Paddle.com is based on Art. 6 subpara. 1 point b of GDPR. Furthermore, Paddle.com allows the Company to access the following payment data: Your email address, your payment method (e.g. by credit card), but not the payment details itself, in order to obtain an overview over the Service's performance. This use is based on Art. 6 subpara. 1 point of GDPR, while the legitimate interest of Paddle.com is to transparently communicate its sales of the Service to the Company; the legitimate interest of the Service is to know about its revenues generated by Paddle.com. The user, data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from Paddle. A revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual) payment processing.</p>

            <p>CRYPTEE is fully committed to EU GDPR.</p>
            <p>Based on Article 25 and Recital 78, the Service fits into the category of "Data protection by design and by default", by allowing only the users themselves to hold decryption keys, and not having access to the users' unencrypted information.</p>
            <p>We are transparent and upfront with our users regarding the information we process/store, the purpose, and in which form we store it.</p>
            <p>We only transmit user data outside the EU in encrypted form, of which the encryption keys are held by our users and not by us.</p>
            <p>We do not use cookies. The only identifier stored on the site is stored either in localStorage or sessionStorage, employed to authenticate, identify and secure users while using the service. More information regarding this is below in Cookies &amp; Local Storage section.</p>

            <p><strong>Name &amp; Address of the Data Controller</strong></p>
            <p>Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is:</p>
            <p>Svartlab OÃœ, Estonia. https://svartlab.com - info@svartlab.com</p>

            <p><strong>Contact Possibility</strong></p>
            <p>The Service contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, which also includes an e-mail address. If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. </p>

            <p><strong>Minimization, Routine Erasure &amp; Blocking of Personal Data</strong></p>
            <p>Due to the nature of the Service, we do not possess any personally identifiable data. Other than Email, Smart ID or Mobile ID consensually provided by the data subject to use the Service more conveniently. We process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which we (the controller) is subject to.
              If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements. </p>

            <p><strong>Transparency &amp; Data Portability</strong></p>
            <p>We transparently show all our users every piece of information we have linked to their accounts, and allow them to easily see, delete, or export their data. Since we do not possess the ability to decrypt our users' encrypted pieces of data, we instead allow our users to export/download these data in the encrypted format we store on our servers.</p>

These cookies aren't used by Crypt.ee and you may delete or block them at any time. See Cloudflare's Cookie Policy for more details: <span class="deets">https://www.cloudflare.com/cookie-policy/</span></p>
            <p>Our payment processor Paddle's checkout process relies on cookies to make their checkout function. However these cookies are flushed automatically by Cryptee as soon as the checkout process is completed. You may read their end user privacy policy for more details: <span class="deets">https://paddle.com/privacy-end-user</span> While their privacy policy is rather extensive, most of the items are concerning their redirect-based checkout flow. Cryptee however uses an embedded-inline checkout flow, in which we specifically limit, minimize and override the amount of information that could be collected by Paddle.</p>
            <p>We also have a script that regularly deletes all cookies on each page load. This is used as an additional measure to ensure none of our providers can start adding unsolicited cookies in the future.</p>
