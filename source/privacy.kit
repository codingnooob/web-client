         <p>In the following policy, Cryptee or Crypt.ee refers to the service offered by Svartlab OÃœ (the "Company" or "We") through the crypt.ee website (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains (i) what information we collect through your access and use of our Service (ii) the use we make of such information; and (iii) the security level we provide for protecting such information. By visiting crypt.ee and using the Services provided here, you consent to the terms outlined in this privacy policy.</p>

         <h2 class="subtitle">Legal Framework</h2>

         <p>The Company is domiciled in Estonia, and thus governed by the laws and regulations of Estonia.</p>

         <h2 class="subtitle">Data Related to Opening of an Account</h2>

         <p>Any emails provided to the Service through either our waiting list, optional email verification, or optional notification/recovery email setting in your account, are considered personal data as defined and under protection by the Estonian Personal Data Protection Act. </p>
         <p>Such data will only be used to log you in, contact you with important notifications about the Service, to send you an invitation link to create your account, to verify your account, or to send you password recovery links if you choose to opt in.</p>

         <h2 class="subtitle">Data Collection</h2>

         <p>Our policy is to collect as little user information as possible to ensure a completely private and anonymous user experience when using the Service. We also have no technical means to access your encrypted data's documents' or contacts' contents.</p>
         <p>Service's user data collection is limited to the following:</p>

         <p><strong>Visiting our website</strong></br>
         We employ an installation of Google Analytics on our static pages for visitors and logged-out sections of the page only. No analytics software is employed on any of the internal/logged-in pages. It is not possible for us to link our analytics data (such as IP addresses) to user accounts.</p>

         <p><strong>Account creation</strong></br>
         We do not require ANY personal information to create an account but you may provide an email address for login and password recovery purposes. Should you choose to provide it, we do associate your email address with your account (in order to be able to provide you the Service). We will also store your account creation time.</p>

         <p><strong>Account activity</strong></br>
         In order to provide you the Service, we have access to the following metadata: folder colors, number of documents/files in each folder, document &amp; bytesizes after encryption, generation/version identifiers for each document/file (to let you know if a document/file was changed on another device of yours) number of contacts, amount of storage space used, last opened document/file's id#, tags of documents/files, numerical sort order of folders, payment activation and deactivation dates, first payment date, all payment amounts, upcoming and past payment dates, subscription plan associated with your account, invoices for payments, whether a discount was applied or not, payment time and the method of payment used.<br><br>We do NOT have access to encrypted contacts' or documents'/files' contents. We do NOT have access to any specific payment information. More information regarding payments related information is below.</p>

         <p><strong>Communicating with the Company</strong></br>
         Your communications with the Company, such as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff.</p>

         <p><strong>IP Logging</strong></br>
         We do not log the IP addresses used to access the Service.</p>

         <p><strong>Payment Information</strong></br>
         The Company relies on third parties to process payments, so the Company necessarily must share your user identification number with the payment processor to be able to know which account the payment will be applied to. We do not otherwise store any of your payment information.</p>

         <h2 class="subtitle">Data Use</h2>

         <p>We do not have any advertising on our site. Any data that we do have will never be shared except under the circumstances described below in Data Disclosure.</p>

         <h2 class="subtitle">Data Storage</h2>

         <p>Your contacts' information, documents'/files' contents are ALWAYS stored in encrypted format. Offline backups may be stored periodically, but these will be backups of already encrypted files. We do not possess the ability to access any user encrypted contacts' information, documents'/files' contents on either the live servers or in the backups.</p>

         <h2 class="subtitle">Data Retention</h2>

         <p>When a user account is closed, all user data, including contacts' information, documents'/files' contents are immediately deleted from production servers. Active accounts will have data retained indefinitely. Deleted contacts, documents/files are also instantly deleted from production servers. Deleted data may be retained in our backups for up to 30 days.</p>

         <h2 class="subtitle">Data Disclosure</h2>

         <p>We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we receive an enforceable court order. If a request is made for encrypted contacts' information, documents'/files' contents that we do not possess the ability to decrypt, the fully encrypted contacts' information, documents'/files' contents or other user data disclosed above in the data collection section may be turned over. If permitted by law, we will always contact a user first before any data disclosure, given that we have a method to contact the user such as the user's email address.</p>

         <h2 class="subtitle">Modifications to Privacy Policy</h2>

         <p>We reserve the right to periodically review and change this policy from time to time. Continued use of the Service will be deemed as acceptance of such changes.</p>

         <h2 class="subtitle">Applicable Law</h2>

         <p>This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the substantive laws of Estonia. The exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement is the Harju County Court in Tallinn Estonia.</p>
