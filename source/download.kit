                <strong>why is cryptee not available on the app stores?</strong>
                <p class="lowercase justify">

                <p class="lowercase justify">
                    Apple's &amp; Google's app stores are centralized stores, run by two of the biggest monopolies in tech, dictating app developers to obey <a href="https://timetoplayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external">incredibly unfair rules</a> that only benefit apple &amp; google.<br><br> in addition, app stores can –and often do– censor / remove apps on behalf of foreign governments. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20907228/apple-quartz-app-store-china-removal-hong-kong-protests-censorship">(i.e. apple removed the quartz news' app from the chinese app store over its hong kong coverage)</a>. internet on the other hand, is open, free, de-centralized, and no third-party monopolistic company can casually decide to shut another company down.

                <p class="bold">№ 2 &nbsp; SLOW UPDATES</p>
                <p class="lowercase justify">
                    App stores can –and often do– delay, postpone, hold back or downright disallow app updates. Firstly, in the security &amp; privacy industry every minute counts, and we think app stores can sometimes be too slow.<br><br> Secondly, we strongly believe that apple or google shouldn't have the power to dictate which apps can or cannot receive updates. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/31/apple-telegram-ios-app-russia-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external">i.e. apple blocked telegram from issuing updates after russia ordered the app's removal from the app store, which at the time caused telegram to miss the deadline for gdpr compliance.</a>.

                <p class="bold">№ 3 &nbsp; APP STORE TAX</p>
                <p class="lowercase justify">
                    App stores mandate that we use their payment systems, and they take a 30% cut. We think this is absurd both from a privacy &amp; financial perspective. so we're not a big fan of apple's &amp; google's monopoly on payments processing, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8471988/spotify-netflix-bypassing-apple-app-store-billing-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external">neither are companies like Spotify or Netflix</a>.

                <p class="bold">№ 4 &nbsp; DENIABILITY</p>
                <p class="lowercase justify">
                    App stores leave traces & evidence of your app downloads. causing your download history or purchase history to show you're using cryptee. as a company advocating for privacy, and deniability, we think this is unnecessary, and you should have the freedom to hide that you're using cryptee.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature heavy">
                <p class="bold">№ 5 &nbsp; PRACTICALITY &amp; COST</p>
                <p class="lowercase justify">
                    We can offer all of cryptee's features using web technologies, and having native-apps wouldn't provide any added benefits. you can install and use cryptee offline just like all other apps, and we promise it will work equally smoothly and fast.<br><br> so at the moment, as a small startup, we don't see any reason why we should waste company resources on 5 more developers to create native apps for Mac OS X, Windows, iOS, Android and Linux.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature heavy">
                <p class="bold">№ 6 &nbsp; SPEED</p>
                <p class="lowercase justify">
                    you're already here. which means if you're reading this, you can install the app with one click, right from your browser. why waste more time navigating to a store owned by a monopoly, searching for the app there again and waiting for it to download and install?<br><br> life is short. let's not waste our time, nor our money making apple or google's monopolies stronger.
