                    i can't see the security check. where is it?

                <p class="lowercase justify">
                    sometimes ad blockers can mistakenly block our captcha / security check mechanism. if you can't see the captcha / security check button please try disabling your ad blocker / vpn or dns-based content filter that may be blocking it and try again.

                <p class="bold">
                    why do I have to complete a captcha?
                </p>
                <p class="lowercase justify">
                    if you're reading this, you must be a human. we believe you! but sadly our servers &amp; security systems still have much to learn about humanity. completing the captcha proves to our servers that you are indeed a human and allows you to access cryptee. 
                    <br><br>
                    you'd be surprised to know how many bots and malicious actors are trying to attack our platform. sadly, we need silly measures like these to defend ourselves.

                <p class="bold">
                    what can I do to prevent this in the future?
                </p>
                <p class="lowercase justify">
                    if you are on a personal connection, like at home, you can run an anti-virus scan on your device to make sure it is not infected with malware.
                    <br><br>
                    if you are at an office or shared network, you can ask the network administrator to run a scan across the network looking for misconfigured or infected devices.
