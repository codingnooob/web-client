**Important Note**
_If you have any account-specific issues, like having problems signing-in, resetting your password, or issues related to your payments etc, you should first contact our [helpdesk](https://crypt.ee/help). We use Github to track issues affecting all users / bugs with the apps or service, and due to the fact that we can't exchange account-specific information on Github, our Helpdesk is much better equipped to handle account related issues._
